Hiding data in new and interesting places has always been a fun objective for anyone who likes creating and solving challenges. One of the interesting secret hiding places for data I like to use is server headers. 

I found out that you can override server headers live in-page with PHP's `header()` function. Combine this with some ascii art, and in the header of a server response you can now show people super hidden ascii art.

Here's the code to make it happen. Replace the `$subject` with new ascii art. 

    <?php
    $i = 0;
    $subject= "
    #    ,-''''-.
    #   (.  ,.   L        ___...__
    #   /7} ,-`  `'-==''``        ''._
    #  //{                           '`.
    #  \_,X ,                         : )
    #      7                          ;`
    #      :                  ,       /
    #       \_,                \     ;
    #         Y   L_    __..--':`.    L
    #         |  /| ````       ;  y  J
    #         [ j J            / / L ;
    #         | |Y \          /_J  | |
    #         L_J/_)         /_)   L_J
    #        /_)                   /_)";
    $header_name= "blackmagic-";
    foreach(preg_split("/((\r?\n)|(\r\n?))/", $subject) as $line){
    
        $pre = "";
        if($i<10)
            $pre = "00";
        elseif ($i<100)
            $pre = "0";
    
    
    
        header( "{$header_name}{$pre}{$i}: {$line}");
        $i++;
    
    }
    ?>
