I buy domains. I buy stupid domains. I buy cheap domains. Put this together, mix it with mild recklessness towards my own finances, and you get hundreds of stupid domains. At one point my namecheap.com account held over ****150**** domains.

Here's some highlights of some of the more **safe-for-work** domains

- botnet.party
- grubby.site
- heckin.download
- illegal.space
- malicious.tech
- malware.loan
- totallynotavirus.download (my fav)
- phishing.download
- rootkit.download
- trustworthy.website
- legit.host
- [cont]

I mainly buy these domains for stupid projects, ideas, etc. One project idea was buy as many $0.88 domains from namecheap (bless), and make a shady url Â generator. Others were just to creep people out with emails, such as uj893mw94@totallynotavirus.download.

On August 11th, 2017, I bought a bunch of domains. One of these domains, was ******eggplant.tech, ******purchased for $0.88 cents. A fairly harmless domain, to be used in conjunction with whatever I was working on at the time.

For months, this domain sat doing nothing, along with **many** of the other domains I have aquired. I mean, what do you do with eggplant.tech anyways? Well, someone had an idea in mind. And money. I have never directly listed domains for sale, but that doesn't stop the internet from wanting to buy stupid things. I know this pretty well.

On Febuary 12th, I got this email.

![](2018/12/image-15.png "Domain offer for eggplant.tech for !$300!")

$****300 dollars. For eggplant.tech, a domain I bought for **eighty-eight cents. ******What do you do in a situation like this? **SELL IT.** You sell that as fast as possible.

A few weeks later, the domain is transfered, and the money in my paypal. Whoever the brave, stupid soul that paid $300 for eggplant.tech is; god bless you man. I hope you do something interesting with it, because I sure won't.

UPDATE:
The domain owner has still not update DNS records. The domain eggplant.tech still points to an unprovisioned server of mine.
