One of the interesting secret hiding places for data I like to use is server headers. </p>\n<p>I found out that you can override server headers live in-page with PHP's <code>header()</code> function. Combine this with some ascii art, and in the header of a server response you can now show people super hidden ascii art.</p>\n<p>Here's the code to make it happen. Replace the <code>$subject</code> with new ascii art. </p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;?php\n$i = 0;\n$subject= \"\n#    ,-''''-.\n#   (.  ,.
