I buy stupid domains. I buy cheap domains. Put this together, mix it with mild recklessness towards my own finances, and you get hundreds of stupid domains.

I have never directly listed domains for sale, but that doesn't stop the internet from wanting to buy stupid things.

Whoever the brave, stupid soul that paid $300 for eggplant.tech is; god bless you man. I hope you do something interesting with it, because I sure won't.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe domain owner has still not update DNS records.
