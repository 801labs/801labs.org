Ready to unleash your inner hacker and outdoor adventurer? Join us for Hacker Camp — a weekend-long getaway (Friday May 16th to Sunday May 18th) where tech and nature collide. 

This isn’t your average campout; think of it as a mashup of a security conference with a dash of wilderness survival. We’ll be teaching everything from lock picking , to social engineering, and even fire starting. 
We'll also have board and card games to keep the good vibes going for those members of your party not interested in hacking. No experience? No problem! We welcome everyone from the tech-curious to the seasoned pros. See you at the campfire!

Please fill out this form to indicate your interest and we will email you when it is time! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqTQv-4QNz3h0hi2B4N302L-pq5wGjKNHfEgYs_d7PNFbiVA/viewform
